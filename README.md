# Crime
Console app written in C++ that analyzes crime data from around Chicago. Written to familiarize myself with C++ concepts and learn lambda expressions.

The Crime-2014-2015.csv file is a small file containing crime information for only the years 2014 and 2015. This file will still take a couple minutes to analyze.
